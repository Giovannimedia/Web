    experience. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with you.
</p>
<p>
    We also use Personal Data as necessary for the following legitimate
    business interests:
</p>
<p>
    • To update and synchronize Service features across multiple devices (i.e.,
    so a draft email you begin on one device will be available on your other
    device(s));

    as job titles and profile photos) about other individuals with whom you
    communicate through the Service);

<p>
    • To respond to your inquiries, comments, feedback or questions and provide
    onboarding support;

    • To manage our relationship with you, which includes sending
    administrative information to you relating to our Service and changes to
    our terms, conditions, and policies and sending account verification or
    technical/security notices;
</p>
<p>
    • To analyze how you interact with our Service and provide, maintain and
    improve the content and functionality of the Service and our customer
    relationships and experiences, develop our business and inform our
    marketing strategy;
</p>
<p>
    • To administer and protect our business and the Site, prevent fraud,
    criminal activity, or misuses of our Site, and to ensure the security of
    our IT systems, architecture and networks (including troubleshooting,
    testing, system maintenance, support and hosting of data); and
</p>
<p>
    • To comply with legal obligations and legal process and to protect our
    rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or
    other third parties, and recover debts due to us.

of individuals in the European Union ("EU"), please see the "<a href="#EU_Users">EU Users</a>" section below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Aggregated Information.</strong>
    We may aggregate Personal Data and use the aggregated information to
    analyze the effectiveness of our Service, to improve and add features to
    our Service, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to
    time, we may analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of
    our Services. We may collect aggregated information through the Service,

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Marketing. </strong>
    We may contact you to provide information we believe will be of interest to
    you. For instance, if you elect to provide your email address, we may use
    that information to send you promotional information about our products and
    services. If we do, where required by law, for example if you are in the
    EU, we will only send you such emails if you consent to us doing so at the
    time you provide us with your Personal Data. You may opt out of receiving
    emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we
    send you or by <a href="#Contact_Us">contacting us</a>. If you unsubscribe
    from our marketing lists, you will no longer receive marketing
    communications but we will continue to contact you regarding our Site and
    Services and to respond to your requests.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE PERSONAL DATA</strong>
</p>

        relationship management services, customer service providers, payment
        processors; web and app analytics services, and data brokers.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, we only share Email Content Data with

        these parties will access, process or store Personal Data in the course
        of performing their duties to us.
    </li>

        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
        If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,
        reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of
        our assets, or transition of service to another provider, your Personal
        Data and other information may be shared in the diligence process with

        (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent fraud,
        (iv) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
        users of the Site, or the public, or (v) protect against legal

    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>DATA RETENTION</strong>
</p>

    We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes
    described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need
    to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other
    purposes), whichever is the longer.
</p>
<p>
    If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain
    information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving
    these communications and in accordance with our policies.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we
    will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the

    Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can
    achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
    requirements.

    in conducting our business and developing a business relationship with you.
    This Privacy Policy describes when we process your Personal Data for our

<p>
    <strong>Your Rights</strong>
    . Pursuant to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (or

<p>
    • <strong>Right of access:</strong> If you ask us, we will confirm whether
    we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of

    additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
</p>
<p>

    your Personal Data, such as where you withdraw your consent. If we shared
    your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where possible.

    you with whom we shared your Personal Data with so you can contact them
    directly.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You may ask us to restrict
    or 'block' the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances,
    such as where you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us
    processing it (please read below for information on your right to object).
    We will tell you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we shared
    your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the restriction
    where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we
    will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so you can
    contact them directly.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Right to data portability: </strong>You have the right to obtain
    your Personal Data from us that you consented to give us or that was
    provided to us as necessary in connection with our contract with you, and
    that is processed by automated means. We will give you your Personal Data
    in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may reuse
    it elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Right to object:</strong> You may ask us at any time to stop
    processing your Personal Data, and we will do so:
</p>
<p>
    - If we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your Personal Data
    -- unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
    or we need to process your data in order to establish, exercise, or defend
    legal claims;
</p>
<p>
    - If we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing. We may keep
    minimum information about you in a suppression list in order to ensure your
    choices are respected in the future and to comply with data protection laws

    pursuing the purposes described above);
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent to
    process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at

    conditions a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy
    Shield Panel. For additional information, please visit: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a>.
