If you visit this web site to read information, such as information about one of our services, we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer’s web browser.

<p>
    <strong>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <!-- <strong>Superhuman Content</strong> -->
    Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our web site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps [Giovanni media] to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same [Giovanni Media] website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the web site or to monitor how our users navigate the web site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.

    <strong>General. </strong>
    We rely on our Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data that
    we receive from the EU and Switzerland to Superhuman in the U.S. and we
    process such Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles
    of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data
    Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and
    Liability ("<strong>Privacy Shield Principles</strong>"), as described
    below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Notice and Choice. </strong>
    This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and
    transferred under the Privacy Shield and the choice that you have with
    respect to such Personal Data. It also provides information about other
    Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Accountability for Onward Transfers. </strong>
    We may be accountable for the Personal Data we receive under the Privacy
    Shield that we may transfer to third-party service providers (described in
    the section "How We Share and Disclose Personal Data" above). If such
    service providers process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the
    Privacy Shield Principles, we are responsible for the harm caused.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security<a name="_cp_text_2_279"></a>. </strong>
    We maintain security measures to protect Personal Data as described in the
    "Security" section of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. </strong>
    We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its
    intended use, and that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as
    we retain it. Our data retention practices are described in the "Data
    Retention" section of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Access. </strong>
    EU users have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal
    Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the
    Privacy Shield Principles. Please see the "Your Rights" section above for more information on the rights of users in the EU (and,
    to the extent applicable, users in Switzerland).
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Recourse, Enforcement, Liability.</strong>
    In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Superhuman commits to
    resolve complaints about our processing of your Personal Data. EU and Swiss
    users with inquiries or complaints regarding this Private Shield Policy
should first contact Superhuman at: <a href="mailto:privacy@superhuman.com">privacy@superhuman.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to
    an alternative dispute resolution provider. If you have an unresolved
    privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily,
    please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider JAMS
    (free of charge) at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under certain
    conditions a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy
    Shield Panel. For additional information, please visit: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a>.

    We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal
    Trade Commission with respect to Personal Data received or transferred
    pursuant to the Frameworks.
