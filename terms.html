    materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident

    <strong><u>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</u></strong>
    <strong>
        : PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<u></u>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in
    this Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any
    and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and
    Superhuman, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service
    (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any
    aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved
    exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in
    accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you
    may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
    Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing
    issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such
    agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You
    agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Superhuman are
    each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
    action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge
    or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
    enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>
        Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
        Relief
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            YOU AND SUPERHUMAN AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
            THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
            CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
            PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SUPERHUMAN AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR
            PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
            CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND
            DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING
            RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
            NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU
            MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC
            INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR
            THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>c. </strong>
    <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Superhuman is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
    efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the
    customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at
    hello@superhuman.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who
    intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
    mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Superhuman
    should be sent to 465 California St, #1200, San Francisco CA 94104 ("Notice
    Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim
    or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Superhuman and
    you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the
    Notice is received, you or Superhuman may commence an arbitration
    proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
    by Superhuman or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after
    the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Superhuman is
    entitled.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>d. </strong>
    <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
    the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures,
    including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA
    Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the
AAA, please visit its website,    <a href="https://www.adr.org">https://www.adr.org</a>. Information about
    the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's
    consumer arbitration page,
    <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration">
        https://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration
    </a>
    . If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any
    term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
    Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that
    the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not
    result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow
    the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are
    for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues
    relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
    Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler
    and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
    arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis
    that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and
    applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
    may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Unless Superhuman and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
    take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
    consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
    If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall
    be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Superhuman agrees
    that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
    basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
    hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If
    your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
    the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
    conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
    sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
    award is based.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>e. </strong>
    <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively,
    the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise
    provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought
    is $75,000 or less, at your request, Superhuman will pay all Arbitration
    Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able
    to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay
    your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
    determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your
    portion of the Arbitration Fees, Superhuman will pay your portion of such
    fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
    arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
    Superhuman will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems
    necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any
    payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>f. </strong>
    <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
    award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of
    all parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>g. </strong>
    <strong>Severability</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
    Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled "Prohibition of
    Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is
    invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or
    provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
    comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
    term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as
    so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
    provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and
    Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or
    unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be
    null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
    unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.
    The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>h. </strong>
    <strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary,
    Superhuman agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration
    Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user
    of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Superhuman
    written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice
    Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing
    that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the
    language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted
    these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms
    of Service).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Termination</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You agree that Superhuman, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate
    your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and
    discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without
    limitation, for lack of use or if Superhuman believes that you have
    violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms
    of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may
    be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to
    appropriate law enforcement authorities. Superhuman may also in its sole
    discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part
    thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your
    access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be
    effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Superhuman
    may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related
    information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such
    files or the Service. Further, you agree that Superhuman will not be liable
    to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the
    Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>User Disputes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any
    other user in connection with the Service and Superhuman will have no
    liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Superhuman reserves the
    right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes
    between you and any other user of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>General</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and
    Superhuman and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior
    agreements between you and Superhuman with respect to the Service. You also
    may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you
    use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party
    software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State
    of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With
    respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
    above, you and Superhuman agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
    jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco
    County, California. The failure of Superhuman to exercise or enforce any
    right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver
    of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is
    found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
    nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
    parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
    of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that
    regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
    action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of
    Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
    action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and
    of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
    administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the
    same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
    and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may
    not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of
    Superhuman, but Superhuman may assign, sublicense, or transfer any or all
    of its rights and obligations under this Terms of Service without
    restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
    convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you
    may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide
    notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by
    displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
</p>
<p>
